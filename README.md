# Temporal Regression Analysis Project

# Research Hypothesis:
- Post-operative patients with high SOFA scores show increasing metabolite values over time after ICU admission and are more likely to develop ARDS.

# Sample Size: 
- 40 critically ill post-operative ICU patients.

# Objective: 
- Conduct a temporal regression analysis to assess the relationship between SOFA scores, metabolite values, and the likelihood of developing ARDS.

# Plan of Action:
- Conducted a study to investigate if post-operative patients with high SOFA scores exhibit increasing metabolite values over time and a higher likelihood of developing ARDS.
- Utilized a sample of 40 critically ill ICU patients undergoing surgery.
- Performed temporal regression analysis to evaluate the hypothesis and compare outcomes between cohorts with time periods ranging (less than 3 days, 3-6 days, 6-9 days and 9-12 days after surgery)

# Key Findings:
- No specific trends were observed in the metabolite values over time, indicating a lack of consistent increase or decrease across the defined time periods.
- Metabolite fluctuations appeared random without a clear pattern correlating to the duration post-surgery or SOFA score severity.

# Possible Explanations for the Results:
- Individual Variation: The random fluctuations in metabolite levels might reflect individual physiological responses to surgery, which can vary significantly due to factors like pre-existing conditions, age, and surgical intervention specifics.
- Sample Size Limitations: A sample of 40 patients may not provide sufficient power to detect subtle trends or differences in metabolite changes over time.
- Complexity of Metabolic Responses: Post-operative metabolic responses can be influenced by numerous factors, including medications, treatments like fluid therapy or mechanical ventilation, and complications such as infections or other organ dysfunctions.
# Clinical Implications:
- The absence of detectable trends in metabolite levels suggests that monitoring these may not provide reliable indicators for the development of ARDS in post-operative patients solely based on the time intervals and SOFA scores used in this study.
- Further research with a larger cohort and more frequent sampling might be necessary to clarify the role of metabolites in predicting ARDS risk post-surgery.
# Recommendations for Future Research:
- Increasing the sample size to enhance the statistical power of the study.
- Implementing more frequent or strategically timed sampling of metabolites to capture relevant changes more effectively.
- Exploring additional variables such as specific types of surgery, patient demographics, and detailed clinical interventions that might influence metabolite dynamics.

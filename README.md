# Metabolomic Profiling as Predictive Biomarkers for the Early Detection of ARDS in ICU Patients
# Objective
-Investigate the association between plasma metabolite levels and SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) scores in ICU patients to identify potential biomarkers for early detection and risk stratification of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
# Methods
-Conducted Spearman correlation analysis to assess relationships between 86 plasma metabolites and SOFA scores across four distinct post-operative periods.

-Performed pathway enrichment analysis using KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and SMPDB (Small Molecule Pathway Database) to identify significant metabolic pathways.
# Key Findings
-Identified significant metabolic pathways associated with clinical severity in early post-operative phases, including Fructose-Mannose and Galactose metabolism.

-Demonstrated the evolving and significant correlations of metabolites like beta-hydroxy acids, purine nucleosides, and various amino acids across different post-operative phases.

-Highlighted significant correlations and metabolic pathway involvements that could potentially influence clinical outcomes and ARDS pathogenesis.
# Impact
-The study's findings contribute to the precision-medicine approach in critical care, enhancing the understanding of ARDS at a molecular level and aiding in the development of targeted therapies.
